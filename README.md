### Project 1: [Diagonal Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/buffos/aind_projects/tree/master/prj01.aind.sudoku)

The basic goal of the project is to get the student acquainted with the
basic idea of the course and introduce to the concepts of search and
constraint satisfaction

### Project 2: [Build a game playing agent for the game of Isolation](https://github.com/buffos/aind_projects/tree/master/prj02.aind.isolation)

In this project we are concentrated on adversarial search and basically
in Minimax , Alpha-Beta algorithms and Iterative Deepening. Also we see
important it is to create a good heuristic.

### Project 3: [Classical Planning](https://github.com/buffos/aind_projects/tree/master/prj03.aind.planning)

The goal of the project is to understand the formulation of Planning problems
in the language of PDDL, understand forward and backward State Space Search.
We are also create a planning graph, the basis of GRAPHPLAN, and extract a heuristic
to help is in the forward state space search.
